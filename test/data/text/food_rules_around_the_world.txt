Food Prohibitions and Restrictions  

The majority of Japanese have no specific food restrictions. But many people around the world have rules about food. They are not supposed to eat certain foods. 
Many rules about food are related to religious beliefs. Other rules are followed for cultural, health or environmental reasons.
Let’s look at rules about food in three major religions, and in vegetarianism.

Judaism / Kosher Food

The majority of Jewish people live in Israel and the United States. There are about 14.2 million Jewish people in the world.

Judaism has a set of laws about food. It is called kashrut. This word means “proper” or “correct.” Kashrut explains dietary rules in detail: which foods can or cannot be eaten, and the way in which animals must be slaughtered (killed) for meat. The food that Jewish people are allowed to eat is called kosher food.

Here are examples of foods that Jewish people are not supposed to eat:

・pork and rabbit
・shellfish (such as shrimp, crab, mussels and lobster)
・meat and dairy foods together: meat and milk products must not be cooked or eaten together. For example, eating a cheeseburger goes against this rule.

Kosher Foods:
In some countries, you can see the word “kosher” on food packages and restaurant signs.
Some people who are not Jewish also look for foods labeled  “kosher,” because they think kosher foods are cleaner and higher-quality.



Passover: 
This is a Jewish springtime festival. Bread that is leavened (that rises during baking) is not supposed to be eaten during this period.

Yom Kippur: 
This is one of two Jewish High Holy Days. On this day, Jewish people fast (consume no food or liquid) for 25 hours.

Islam / Halal Food

The majority of Muslim people live in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. There are about 1.6 billion Muslim people in the world.
 
In Islam, the concept of halal is followed in the diet and in daily life. Halal means “lawful” or “permitted.”
The foods that Muslims are allowed to eat are called halal foods. 
Prohibited foods are called haram foods. Haram means “forbidden.”

Here are examples of foods and drinks that Muslim people are not supposed to consume:

・pork: All pork products, including meat,  gelatin and lard, are prohibited. This means, for example, that tonkotsu ramen may not be eaten. 

・alcoholic beverages: In addition, the Japanese seasoning mirin may not be used in foods. 
Halal meat:  
Muslims are allowed to eat meat other than pork, but the animals are supposed to be slaughtered according to halal methods.
Ramadan:  
This is a 30-day period of fasting (consuming no food or liquid) during daylight hours. “Ramadan” means the ninth month of the Islamic calendar.
After 30 days, Muslims have a big festival. It is called Eid Ul-Fitr.

Hinduism

Hinduism is one of the most ancient religions in the world.
The majority of Hindu people live in India and Nepal. 
There are about 1.03 billion Hindu people in the world.

In Hinduism, eating meat is not prohibited, but many people are vegetarians or avoid eating meat. 
Hindus respect life, and generally do not like killing animals.

Hindu people do not eat beef. They consider cows to be sacred animals. They do consume cow’s milk and milk products, such as yogurt and butter.
Some Hindu people follow food guidelines more strictly than others. 


Here are examples of foods and drinks that many Hindu people do not consume:
・meat
・fish
・eggs
・alcoholic beverages
・five pungent roots (shallots, leeks, garlic, scallions and hingu): These are actually vegetables, but they are believed to have negative effects on the mind and body.

Unclean left hand:
Hinduism considers the left hand to be unclean. Hindus eat food with their hand. They use only the right hand to eat, never the left hand.

Vegetarianism

People who do not eat meat or fish are called vegetarians.
Many Hindus are vegetarians for reasons related to their religious beliefs. 
Many people are vegetarian for non-religious reasons. The reasons may be health-related, ethical or environmental.
The number of vegetarians is increasing, mainly in Europe and North America.

There are many types of vegetarians. For example

Ovo-vegetarians:
They do not eat meat, fish eggs or dairy products, but they eat eggs. “Ovo” means egg. 

Lacto-vegetarians: 
They do not eat meat, fish or eggs, but they eat dairy products. “Lacto” means milk.

Ovo-lacto-vegetarians:
They do not eat meat or fish, but they eat eggs and dairy products. 

Vegans:
They do not eat any animal products. This includes eggs, dairy products and honey.


Diverse Eating Habits

There are many people around the world who do not eat certain foods. The reasons may be religious, cultural or personal. When you invite someone for a meal, you might not know what foods they do and do not eat.

So it is important to ask your guests, “Do you have any food restrictions?”
