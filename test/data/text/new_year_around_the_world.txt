New Year Celebrations around the World

Happy New Year and a prosperous 2017! How was your New Year?

Many people around the world celebrate the New Year on January 1st on the Gregorian calendar. This is the most commonly used calendar in the world.
There are different ways of celebrating the New Year from country to country and from culture to culture.

There are also a number of calendars used around the world.  Many people celebrate the New Year according to the calendar used in their own culture. 

Let’s take a look at the world’s New Year celebrations and dates.

The New Year in the United States

Let’s take a look at the New Year in the United States. People in the U.S. start celebrating on December 31st, New Year’s Eve.

Many people have a party with their friends or family. Just before midnight, they start a countdown: “10, 9, 8...” At midnight, they say, “Happy New Year!” They often hug or kiss one another and throw confetti. People also drink champagne to celebrate.

One of the largest New Year’s Eve countdown events is held in Times Square in New York City. It is always shown on TV.

 In the morning on New Year’s Day, many people watch a famous parade, the Rose Parade, on TV. Some people have brunch at home or at a restaurant. In the afternoon, there are several college football games on TV. Football fans watch the games with friends or family members.

When do people take down Christmas trees?

In Japan, people take down Christmas trees on December 26th, and then start decorating for the New Year. But in the U.S., Christmas trees stay up in many stores and homes during the New Year season. Most people take down Christmas trees around January 3rd.

The Chinese 
New Year

The Chinese New Year is famous throughout the world. Not only China but also a number of other countries in Asia have a public holiday on the Chinese New Year.

The date of the Chinese New Year varies from year to year. The Chinese New Year in 2017 is January 28th. The date is decided according to the lunar calendar.

Family members gather together from all over the world on the Chinese New Year. Millions of people travel during this period!

During the New Year season, Chinese people decorate their doorways and streets with red lanterns and other red decorations. The color red means “happiness” and “luck.” Many towns have events with a “dragon dance” or “lion dance.” People really enjoy them.
Food
People in northern regions make Chinese dumplings on New Year’s Eve. They eat them around midnight. They say dumplings look like silver ingots (the old form of money). Eating dumplings means they will be wealthy in the coming year. 

On the other hand, people in southern regions make sweet rice balls on New Year's Eve. Sweet rice balls are round and mean “harmony.”

“Explosive buying”
There is a new trend in the Chinese New Year season. Many Chinese tourists visit Japan and buy a lot of Japanese products. Bakugai (“explosive buying”) was a buzzword of 2015. Japanese retail stores have come to expect a lot of business from tourists, especially during the Chinese New Year.

Malaysia is a multi-ethnic nation. There are Malays, people of Chinese descent and Indian descent, and indigenous people. Many Malay people are Muslim, and many people of Indian descent are Hindu. Malaysia has four public New Year holidays. Different groups celebrate different holidays.

Hari Raya AidilFitri
About 60 percent of people in Malaysia are Muslim.

Hari Raya AidilFitri is the biggest holiday on the Muslim calendar. Muslims celebrate AidilFitri as the Festival of the Breaking of the Fast. It is the end of Ramadan (the 30-day fasting period). 
They clean their houses thoroughly and buy new clothes in preparation for this day. They go to the mosque to pray, and go to their ancestors’ graves. They visit their family members and relatives. Children are given gift money by adults.
Houses and stores are decorated with a special dish called ketupat.  

Deepavali 
About six percent of people in Malaysia are Hindus.

Deepavali is the biggest holiday on the Hindu calendar. It is also known as the “Festival of Lights.” It celebrates the victory of light (good) over darkness (evil).

Houses and towns are decorated with candles, lanterns and kolams. A kolam is a pattern drawn with colorful rice powder. 
Actually, the date of Hari Raya AidilFitr and Deepavali are not the first days of the year on the Muslim and Hindu calendars. But for Muslim and Hindu people, these are the most important holidays of the year.
The New Year in Thailand

Thailand has a unique New Year festival, called Songkran. Songkran is the New Year on the Thai lunar calendar (around April). It falls in the hottest season in Thailand.

On the New Year, people pour water over Buddha statues, as well as over the hands of the oldest people in each household. This act symbolizes cleansing. The custom expanded into a “water festival.” People splash water on one another in wild outdoor “water fights.”

This event is becoming more and more popular. The New Year’s festival in Thailand attracts a lot of tourists. The Thai government designated April 13th to 15th as national public holidays.

The New Year in Japan

Finally, let’s take a look at New Year celebrations in Japan. Japan has followed the Gregorian calendar since the Meiji era. 

We sometimes see the words “New spring” or “Welcome spring” in this winter season. New Year in the Edo era was the period from late January to the middle of February. This was the season when Japanese apricot trees started blooming.

Nengajo
A nengajo is a New Year greeting card. The number of people who write nengajo is decreasing, because of the popularity of social networking services. According to Nippon Mail Transportation, the number of nengajo printed in 2017 is estimated at 2.85 billion. This is a decrease of two-thirds from 2004.

Osechi
Osechi is traditional Japanese New Year food. Various foods are arranged in boxes called jubako. People finish preparing osechi by New Year’s Eve. However, preparing osechi can be tiring, so buying osechi online or at a department store has become popular. People can enjoy beautiful and fancy osechi made by famous food companies.
