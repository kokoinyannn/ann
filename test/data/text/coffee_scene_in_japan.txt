In 2015, Blue Bottle Coffee opened in Japan.  
It’s a coffeehouse from Oakland, California, U.S.A.

Blue Bottle’s specialty is hand drip coffee. 
It takes a lot of time and effort to make one delicious cup. 
The spirit of the hand drip was influenced by classic Japanese coffeehouses.
But Blue Bottle seemed like a new idea for Japan, so the Japanese media introduced it as a new trend. When it opened, people waited in long lines to get in. 
They felt that this was a new and modern way to drink coffee. 

Let’s look at two other coffee trends and why they took root in Japan.

Starbucks—The Seattle-style Coffeehouse



Starbucks is a coffeehouse chain from Seattle, Washington, U.S.A.
The name “Starbucks” comes from a famous novel Moby-Dick.

Starbucks became popular in the United States in the early 1990s.
Starbucks’ CEO loved the coffeehouses in Italy.
He wanted to bring Italian coffeehouses to the U.S.

Starbucks offered drinks made with espresso.
This was different from other American cafés.
Americans got to know drinks like
caffè latte, cappuccino, and espresso macchiato.








The first Starbucks in Japan opened in Ginza in 1996.
Then Starbucks spread to other parts of Japan.

Japan discovered a new coffee culture―“the Seattle-style coffeehouse.”
For many people, Starbucks is not just a place to enjoy coffee.
It’s a kind of lifestyle.

For example, people buy coffee at Starbucks before they go to work. 
They walk down the street with their Starbucks cup.
It’s just like those scenes in Hollywood movies.
The name Starbucks is now a fashion brand.

People also enjoy spending time in Starbucks coffeehouses. 
They find them relaxing.
They like to read, work, or talk with friends there. 

Starbucks coffee may be a little bit expensive. 
But people don’t just buy Starbucks coffee.
They also buy the Starbucks “atmosphere.”

Convenience Store Coffee
Convenience Store Coffee


In 2013, a new trend hit convenience stores in Japan.
Convenience stores started selling their own coffee.
Not canned coffee―freshly made coffee.

First, customers order coffee at the register and pay.
The cashier gives them a cup.
Customers make their own coffee at the store’s coffee machine.

Hot, fresh coffee―and it’s only 100 yen!
Customers say that the coffee is delicious for the price.
And there are convenience stores everywhere.
It quickly became popular. 

In 2014, 1.5 billion cups of coffee were sold in convenience stores!

In Japan, there are five big convenience store chains:
7-Eleven, Lawson, Family Mart, Circle K Sunkus, and Ministop.

These five companies want to have regular coffee buyers.
They work hard to compete with the other stores.

There have been many changes in the Japanese coffee culture.

Many people have become familiar with different ways to drink coffee.
We have a lot of choices. 

What kind of coffee do you like?
What is important to you: taste, price, atmosphere, or convenience?
Now you can choose any of these.

Which is your money on?
